![About Me](/assets/about.jpeg)

<p> I am a recent Bootcamp graduate and have quickly found a passion for software development. Even though I am new to coding, I have loved computers and technology since I was a kid having built my own PCs since i was a teen.</p>
<p> I have a background as an Educator which I believe is one of the most well rounded fields to come from. Teaching English has taught me the art of all things mechanical and the mechanics tht go into art. Building a stable framework of which to operate is a forgotten, but integral part of teaching and just like coding, you go through several iterations finding errors and correcting them.</p>
<p>Outside of worklife, I'm a gamer and a lover of all media. Theres much to be learned from fiction and we can take fiction as daily inspiration of what to implement in life. Some of my favorite games include Outer Wilds, Legend of Zelda, and Like a Dragon.</p>
